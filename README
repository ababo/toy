Simple OS-like program for x86-64, which dreams to become a real OS.

Design vision (to be implemented):
1. Single address space OS. All available external memory is mapped into it.
2. Persistent applications. They not only survive reboot, but also can be
   transferred to another machine (with a same architecture) and resumed there.
3. Virtual machine for memory protection and security.

Already implemented:
1. Multiboot specification support (for GRUB2 or patched GRUB).
2. Textual VGA-mode (16 colors, limited kprintf).
3. CPU topology detection (sockets, cores, threads) for Intel and AMD CPUs.
4. Convenient page mapping interface.
5. Support of interrupts written in C.
6. Simple preemptive scheduler with SMP support.
7. Synchronization primitives: spinlock, mutex.

Supported compilers:
1. GCC
2. CLang

Build environment:
1. Linux (known to work on recent Ubuntu).
